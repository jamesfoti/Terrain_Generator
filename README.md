This project was heavily influenced and based on Sebastian Lague's tutorial about procedural terrain generation. He explores terrain generation using perlin noise which is applied to a mesh. I simply used his tutorial as an educational tool to allow me to explore these concepts. I simply branched off his tutorial in my own way and created a WebGL application as well. <br/><br/>
